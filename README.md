### Stroke Prediction Project

#### Introduction

According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 11% of global fatalities. Early and accurate prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms for real-time stroke prediction, thereby contributing to healthcare advancements.

We leverage the Stroke Prediction Dataset available on Kaggle for this purpose. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).
